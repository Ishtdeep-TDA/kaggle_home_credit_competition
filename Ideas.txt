# Since the data is huge, think about compressing the data within the dfs and then saving it 
somewhere after compression (probably kaggle and local)

#### Feature engineering ideas 

* Feature around location (zipcode etc)
* Feature around total debt, acc balance etc,
* counts on number of accts, cards, 
* total of tenor 
* date from features
